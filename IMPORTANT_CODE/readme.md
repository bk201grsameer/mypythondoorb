# Controlling Terminal Window with Python and subprocess

The following example demonstrates how to control a terminal window using Python and the `subprocess` module. Specifically, it shows how to create a new terminal window, send commands to it, and interact programmatically with the terminal.

## Example Code

```python
import subprocess

# Create a new terminal
terminal = subprocess.Popen(['powershell', '-NoExit'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE)

while True:
    msg = input("Enter Message: ")
    print(msg)

    if msg == "quit":
        # Close the terminal and exit the program
        terminal.stdin.close()
        terminal.terminate()
        break

    # Print the user-entered message in the terminal
    terminal.stdin.write(f'Write-Host "{msg}"\n'.encode())
    terminal.stdin.flush()

```
## Explanation
```python
   terminal = subprocess.Popen(['powershell', '-NoExit'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
   creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE)
``` 
## Explanation
   ### 1. Terminal Explanation
``` 
    This line creates a new terminal window using subprocess.Popen().
    It launches the PowerShell command (powershell) with the -NoExit flag to keep the   terminal window open.
    The stdin=subprocess.PIPE parameter sets up a pipe to write to the terminal's standard input.
    Finally, creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE creates a new console window for the PowerShell process.

    terminal = subprocess.Popen(['powershell', '-NoExit'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE): 
    This line creates a new terminal window using the subprocess.Popen function. It launches the PowerShell (powershell) command with the -NoExit flag to keep the terminal window open. 
    The stdin=subprocess.PIPE parameter ensures that we can write to the terminal's standard input.
    Finally, creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE is used to create a new console window for the PowerShell process.
    In the code terminal = subprocess.Popen(['powershell', '-NoExit'], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE), the stdin=subprocess.PIPE parameter sets up a pipe to allow writing to the standard input of the new terminal window.
    It means that the program can write to the terminal's standard input using terminal.stdin.write(), but it does not provide direct interactive access to the terminal window from the program itself.

    The purpose of this code is to create a new terminal window and control it programmatically by sending commands or input from the program to the terminal. It allows the program to automate or script interactions with the terminal without manual input.
